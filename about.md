# A BRIEF INTRODUCTION

Resonance (UK) Limited evolved from successful freelance careers in 2002 by award winning Sound designer Andy and his wife Mary Kennedy.Our business is sound capture, design, supervision and postproduction. It has required investment in state of the art equipment over a number of years retaining some bespoke audio equipment from the outset of the digital age. The compilation of a vast array of digital and analogue sound effects recorded and collated over 30 years from a hundreds of productions and projects.

Resonance(UK) Ltd has a strong commitment to the delivery of high quality original soundtracks for film, television and interactive projects with a finite attention to detail. The search for the perfect combination of audio ingredients combined with a need to be original and unique. This has led to nominations and awards over a wide range of productions.

A new branch to the company’s activities is public speaking, lectures and tutorials. This work has included part-time tutorials at The National film and Television school. Other bookings include lectures on sound design at various educational institutes and recordings of presentations by ‘Autism Oxford’ future multi media project.We have worked on everything from short films, commercials & television, interactive media through to large scale feature films with over thirty years experience.

Specialisation on complex effects sequences has been a stream of recent work from intricate action sequences, too big budget CGI’s scenes. We can supply a range of pre mixed elements and designed sounds effects, either for 'temp' or 'final' mixes. A full supervised soundtrack facility from recording to mix are also available.
